        // Is an important concept for dealing with objects,
        // encapsulation is the combination of data and behavior in a package,
        // and hide the specific implementation from the user of the object.

        // The data in the object becomes an instance field,
        // and the process of manipulating the data becomes a method.

        // The key to implementing encapsulation is that methods in a class must never directly access instance fields of other classes.
        // Programs can only interact with object data through object methodsã€‚
        // Encapsulation gives objects a "black box" property: it doesn't matter what's in the box, just how to interact with the box.
        // improved reusability and operability
